  title = {A {{Performance Study}} of {{Containers}} in {{Cloud Environment}}},
  abstract = {Container technology has gained great popularity since containers could provide near-native performance in cloud environment. According to different design purposes and underlying implementations, containers could be classified into application containers (e.g., Docker) and system containers (e.g., LXC). The diversity of containers may lead to a confusing choice about which kind of container is suitable for different usage scenarios. Meanwhile, the architectures of public container services are quite controversial because cloud platforms tend to run containers in virtual machines. From the perspective of performance, an extra virtual machine layer between the bare metal and containers probably brings in unnecessary performance overhead. In this paper, we carry out a performance study to explore the appropriate way to use containers from different perspectives. We first conduct a series of experiments to measure performance differences between application containers and system containers, then evaluate the overhead of extra virtual machine layer between the bare metal and containers, and finally inspect the service quality of ECS (Amazon EC2 Container Service) and GKE (Google Container Engine). Our results show that system containers are more suitable to sustain I/O-bound workload than application containers, because application containers will suffer high I/O latency due to layered filesystem. Running containers in virtual machine would result in severe disk I/O performance degradation up to 42.7 \% and network latency up to 233 \%. We also find out ECS offers better performance than GKE, and cloud platforms could acquire better performance by running containers directly on the bare metal.},

We present a case study where an enterprise application was developed and deployed in the cloud using a monolithic approach and a microservice architecture using the Play web framework. We show the results of performance tests executed on both applications, and we describe the benefits and challenges that existing enterprises can get and face when they implement microservices in their applications.},

  abstract = {In recent years, Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have become a phenomenon presenting the prospect of free high class education to everybody. They bear a tremendous potential for teaching programming to a large and diverse audience. The typical MOOC components, such as video lectures, reading material, and easily assessable quizzes, however, are not sufficient for proper programming education. To learn programming, participants need an option to work on practical programming exercises and to solve actual programming tasks. It is crucial that the participants receive proper feedback on their work in a timely manner. Without a tool for automated assessment of programming assignments, the teaching teams would be restricted to offer optional ungraded exercises only. The paper at hand sketches scenarios how practical programming exercises could be provided and examines the landscape of potentially helpful tools in this context. Automated assessment has a long record in the history of computer science education. We give an overview of existing tools in this field and also explore the question what can and/or should be assessed.},

Education has not remained unaware of this trend, and several educational solutions based on cloud technologies are already in place, especially for software as a service cloud. However, an evaluation of the educational potential of infrastructure and platform clouds has not been explored yet. An evaluation of which type of cloud would be the most beneficial for students to learn, depending on the technical knowledge required for its usage, is missing. Here, the first systematic evaluation of different types of cloud technologies in an advanced course on network overlays with 84 students and four professors is presented. This evaluation tries to answer the question whether cloud technologies (and which specific type of cloud) can be useful in educational scenarios for computer science students by focusing students in the actual tasks at hand. This study demonstrates that platform clouds are valued by both students and professors to achieve the course objectives and that clouds offer a significant improvement over the previous situation in labs where much effort was devoted to setting up the software necessary for course activities. These results most strongly apply to courses in which students interact with resources that are non-self-contained (e.g., network nodes, databases, mechanical equipment, or the cloud itself), but could also apply to other science disciplines that involve programming or performing virtual experiments.},

  abstract = {The rapid development in Information and Communication Technology has had a significant impact on traditional educational systems and learning. Today, E-Learning has become a widely accepted way of learning. With increasing numbers of users, a wide range of learning services and the growth of educational content, E-Learning has emerged as the mode for future learning. However, the volatile user load and massive storage and transfer of rich multimedia content have lead to a need for effective utilization of server side system resources in providing E-Learning services. Cloud computing offers a dynamic provision of virtualized resources, elasticity, scalability, pays as you use and measured service with the ability to dynamically provision and de-provision computing resources as needed. Cloud computing is ideally suited for E-learning systems. In this paper, an E-Learning framework based on cloud computing is presented which efficiently addresses the current challenges in E-Learning. Specifically, the architecture and core components in an efficient E-Learning system are introduced for efficient deployment in the cloud. Moreover, the proposed new framework efficiently blends different components that serve for E-Learning systems as a general architecture and wraps it under ---E-Learning as services|| (EaaS). Our case study-based evaluation suggests that the proposed framework of E-Learning using cloud computing is best suited for the Kuwait Ministry of Education. In addition to better performance and availability, the proposed framework delivers reliable and scalable services for E- Learning systems.},

  abstract = {There is high demand for library routines that can be included into arbitrary programs and executed in parallel in the Cloud. So our approach is to provide a framework that supports the parallelized execution of library routines, written in different programming languages, from any platform. Our Distributed Execution Framework (DEF) allows to (1) deploy arbitrary routines into a central library and (2) integrate these library routines at runtime into user programs in a way that allows the routines to be executed in parallel in the Cloud. The programming and runtime environment of the library routine is completely transparent to the user and the chosen programming and runtime environment. DEF provides client and library APIs with primitives like search\_lib(), create\_task(), submit\_job() which are integrated into the user's program to access the DEF runtime. DEF allows the user to configure clusters in a public/private Cloud and automatically distributes the tasks for executing the library routines on the workers of the cluster.},

To tackle these issues, we provide an integrated system for learning programming that covers source code editing, compiling, execution, submission and evaluation of the process and the result. In this paper, we emphasize on source code editing environment named Doppel and Ganger (D\&G). D\&G is a web based application aimed for monitoring coding process by recording typing activities. It also supports online compilation and execution using an autograder. We have experimented programming practice using this environment and it has shown that D\&G can significantly support the learning process of programming.},

During the recent past, technologies such as email, chat, audioconferencing, videoconferencing and webconferencing were incorporated as new tools in the teaching-learning process. Currently, another step is being walked with the development and the popularization of cloud technologies that are arousing great interest in educational environments. There has been an actively development of cloud platforms with the release of several open-source solutions to build private, public and hybrid clouds such as OpenNebula, Eucalyptus, OpenStack and CloudStack. Each of them has unique features that are not found in the others. In the most basic cloud service model, Infrastructure as a Service, it is possible to provide computational resources as virtual machines. In Computer Science this model offers to teachers and students the possibility of managing virtual infrastructures in which system administration and programming languages practices can be performed without compromising the configuration of the underlying physical compute nodes. In order to test a cloud infrastructure as a tool for learning MPI, two different scenarios were evaluated in this work using CloudStack: a virtual cluster as a MPI execution environment, and an improved virtual cluster whose MPI communication latency was improved. The results of this study are presented in this paper.},

However, Docker concentrates on managing containers on one host, but SaaS providers need a container management solution for multiple hosts. Therefore, a number of tools emerged that claim to solve the problem. This paper classifies the solutions, maps them to requirements from a case study and identifies gaps and integration requirements. We close some of these gaps with our own integration components and tool enhancements, resulting in the currently most complete management suite.},

  abstract = {Internet Protocol (IP) Telephony is growing rapidly in the telecommunication industry. Since IP Telephony curriculum is very new to IT education and also because of the high cost of laboratory equipment, there are very few universities that offer IP Telephony courses. The documentation on IP Telephony laboratory and curriculum is also under-developed. To meet the challenges of this new technology and the needs of IT students, in this paper, we explore how an IT Telephony laboratory can be built upon within the private cloud to serve the class. The main goal of this paper is to share our experience and solutions about building the private cloud computing infrastructure prototype for an IP telephony course. With private cloud computing, hardware resources are virtualized as a resource pool and are managed and maintained as a whole. As demands fluctuate, the CPU, storage, and memory will be dynamically allocated with cloud computing. The overall cost of installing and maintaining the laboratory was decreased considering licensing fees and hardware costs. This research can serve as a reference guide for other IT educators who want to deploy IP Telephony laboratory and curriculum in their institutions.},

We have undertaken this study to gain an understanding of the student concerns in introductory programming courses, in the expectation that a framework could be developed to assist academics with reviewing their courses in subsequent offerings. We have found that at all institutions the main focuses of student comments are the course as a whole and the assessment, although at different universities the comments focus on different aspects of these items.},

  abstract = {Many massive open online courses (MOOC) have been tremendously popular, causing a stir in academic institutions. The most successful courses have reached tens of thousands of participants. In our MOOC on introductory programming, we aimed to improve distinctive challenges that concern most of the open online courses: allowing and requiring the participants to be more active in their online learning ("flipped-classroom"), demanding them to go deeper than typical CS1 course, and added incentives for participant retention by treating the course as a formal entrance exam to CS/IT degree. Our Extreme Apprenticeship (XA) method for programming education appeared to be successful in an online environment as well.},

  abstract = {Since the early 1960's, researchers have built a number of programming languages and environments with the intention of making programming accessible to a larger number of people. This article presents a taxonomy of languages and environments designed to make programming more accessible to novice programmers of all ages. The systems are organized by their primary goal, either to teach programming or to use programming to empower their users, and then, by each system's authors' approach, to making learning to program easier for novice programmers. The article explains all categories in the taxonomy, provides a brief description of the systems in each category, and suggests some avenues for future work in novice programming environments and languages.},
