  title = {A {{Performance Study}} of {{Containers}} in {{Cloud Environment}}},
  abstract = {Container technology has gained great popularity since containers could provide near-native performance in cloud environment. According to different design purposes and underlying implementations, containers could be classified into application containers (e.g., Docker) and system containers (e.g., LXC). The diversity of containers may lead to a confusing choice about which kind of container is suitable for different usage scenarios. Meanwhile, the architectures of public container services are quite controversial because cloud platforms tend to run containers in virtual machines. From the perspective of performance, an extra virtual machine layer between the bare metal and containers probably brings in unnecessary performance overhead. In this paper, we carry out a performance study to explore the appropriate way to use containers from different perspectives. We first conduct a series of experiments to measure performance differences between application containers and system containers, then evaluate the overhead of extra virtual machine layer between the bare metal and containers, and finally inspect the service quality of ECS (Amazon EC2 Container Service) and GKE (Google Container Engine). Our results show that system containers are more suitable to sustain I/O-bound workload than application containers, because application containers will suffer high I/O latency due to layered filesystem. Running containers in virtual machine would result in severe disk I/O performance degradation up to 42.7 \% and network latency up to 233 \%. We also find out ECS offers better performance than GKE, and cloud platforms could acquire better performance by running containers directly on the bare metal.},

In this paper we analyze and test the microservice architecture pattern, used during the last years by large Internet companies like Amazon, Netflix and LinkedIn to deploy large applications in the cloud as a set of small services that can be developed, tested, deployed, scaled, operated and upgraded independently, allowing these companies to gain agility, reduce complexity and scale their applications in the cloud in a more efficient way. We present a case study where an enterprise application was developed and deployed in the cloud using a monolithic approach and a microservice architecture using the Play web framework. We show the results of performance tests executed on both applications, and we describe the benefits and challenges that existing enterprises can get and face when they implement microservices in their applications.},

  abstract = {In recent years, Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have become a phenomenon presenting the prospect of free high class education to everybody. They bear a tremendous potential for teaching programming to a large and diverse audience. The typical MOOC components, such as video lectures, reading material, and easily assessable quizzes, however, are not sufficient for proper programming education. To learn programming, participants need an option to work on practical programming exercises and to solve actual programming tasks. It is crucial that the participants receive proper feedback on their work in a timely manner. Without a tool for automated assessment of programming assignments, the teaching teams would be restricted to offer optional ungraded exercises only. The paper at hand sketches scenarios how practical programming exercises could be provided and examines the landscape of potentially helpful tools in this context. Automated assessment has a long record in the history of computer science education. We give an overview of existing tools in this field and also explore the question what can and/or should be assessed.},

There are strong needs of providing effective system supports for learning programming at scale. Among various desirable characteristics of such system supports, system supports shall allow students to write programs via an online Integrated Development Environment (IDE), allow students to get feedback on how they perform on the given programming exercises, etc. To aim for such effective system supports for learning programming at scale, research teams from Peking University have developed two systems: POP (denoting Peking University Online Programming System) and POJ (denoting Peking University Online Judge System). These two systems have achieved high impact among students around the world (especially those in China). In this paper, we present the overview of the two systems, along with our ongoing and future work on extending the systems for achieving higher effectiveness in supporting learning programming at scale.},

Our Distributed Execution Framework (DEF) allows to (1) deploy arbitrary routines into a central library and (2) integrate these library routines at runtime into user programs in a way that allows the routines to be executed in parallel in the Cloud. The programming and runtime environment of the library routine is completely transparent to the user and the chosen programming and runtime environment. DEF provides client and library APIs with primitives like search\_lib(), create\_task(), submit\_job() which are integrated into the user's program to access the DEF runtime. DEF allows the user to configure clusters in a public/private Cloud and automatically distributes the tasks for executing the library routines on the workers of the cluster.},

Building on learning science research, we created a flexible new technology platform to support students and their instructor as they participated in this new form of instruction. Students work collaboratively on Web-based activities while the instructor interacts with students in a tutorial role. The paper describes our system in detail, outlines the organization of the course that used it, and reviews and evaluates the pilot results. We then discuss the implications for computer science instruction and research in higher education.},

The number of PCs are much less than the students. Although most students have personal computing devices, those devices have various specifications that create difficulties in evaluation. To tackle these issues, we provide an integrated system for learning programming that covers source code editing, compiling, execution, submission and evaluation of the process and the result. In this paper, we emphasize on source code editing environment named Doppel and Ganger (D\&G). D\&G is a web based application aimed for monitoring coding process by recording typing activities. It also supports online compilation and execution using an autograder. We have experimented programming practice using this environment and it has shown that D\&G can significantly support the learning process of programming.},

Such comments have been collated from students in introductory programming courses at four Australian universities. In this paper we present the results of a thematic analysis to see whether there are common themes to the areas students consider most in need of improvement. We have undertaken this study to gain an understanding of the student concerns in introductory programming courses, in the expectation that a framework could be developed to assist academics with reviewing their courses in subsequent offerings. We have found that at all institutions the main focuses of student comments are the course as a whole and the assessment, although at different universities the comments focus on different aspects of these items.},

Finally, open problems and future challenges are introduced. This survey primarily addresses newcomers to the discipline, while offering an academic viewpoint on the topic. In addition, we investigate some practical issues and point out some potential solutions.},

Programming learning demands effort and motivation. However, demotivation is common in many novice-programming students, who are not able to cope with the natural difficulties associated to programming learning. Since many students lack intrinsic motivation it is up to the teacher to find strategies to help students and keep them motivated during the course. The objective of our research was to know more about the pedagogical and motivational strategies used by teachers in the author's institutions to promote programming student's motivation. So we interviewed teachers with diversified experiences in teaching the first programming course.},
