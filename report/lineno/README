                      lineno.sty  v3.07

     $Id: README,v 3.5 2001/07/31 02:57:33 stephan Exp $

The LaTeX package lineno.sty provides line numbers on paragraphs.
After TeX has broken a paragraph into lines there will be line numbers
attached to them, with the possibility to make references through the
LaTeX \ref, \pageref cross reference mechanism.

   COPYING       The LPPL header.
   lineno.sty    The package itself, ready to use.
   lineno.tex    The source documentation.

     which was removed.

Compatibility with other packages:

   wrapfig.sty   works since v2.05

   multicol.sty  works partly since 3.02.  
                 Do NOT use \linelabel.  Do NOT put a multicol in
                 internal vertical mode {table}, {figure}, etc.

   hyperref.sty  \ref to a \linelabel works since v3.03.

   longtable.sty broke with lineno.sty loaded, but not enabled.  
                 This is fixed in v3.04.

To print the documented source:

   Take the style-file `lineno.sty', and feed it to a Un*x shell.  (Or
   download the extracted source documentation `lineno.tex'.)

      csh> source ./lineno.sty
      sh>  . ./lineno.sty

   (Please ignore the error message at the beginning about the iffalse.)
